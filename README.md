# Mots Couture

I love to read, and when I come across a word I don't know, I jot it down on my bookmark to look it up later. It occurred to me that I could not only build an app to streamline this word-jotting and looking-up, but the data set created from it could be really interesting to explore.

As for features & possibilities, I've really just started prototyping, testing and adding to it as I use it. So far, word entry, storage and definition lookup is integrated, alongside simple analytics & visualization. Games, community sharing and deeper analytics are still to be done.

At the same time I started this project, we were exploring using Tailwind CSS for a project at work. I didn't have much experience with it, so I thought I'd use this project as an opportunity to play around with it and test general features and usage. Building it as ReactJS project, with TypeScript, within a NextJS implementation matched the tech stack we were considering. The jury is still out on Tailwind CSS, but it's proving to be both interesting and effective so far.
